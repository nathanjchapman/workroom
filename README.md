### HQ

Keep all your employees (and your accountant) up to date with what projects
you're working on. Keep track of Projects and Addresses with HQ.

### Kronos

Track what tasks and hours your employees are putting in with Kronos, no more
handwritten timecards that get lost in translation.

### Atom

Categorize and classify the kinds of labor your company does. Calculate where your time and money are going based on what your crew are doing.

### Stronghold

Ever forget what door code you gave to who? Or what the code even was? Track all
your Doors (relative to Projects) and Codes with Stronghold. Safely, securely.
